While this \\nflexibility has been rewarding, navigating the decision to select a single table format has unfolded as a new challenge. \\nOneTable, an open-source project [released last year](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/exclusive-microsoft-and-google-join-forces-on-onetable-an-open-source-solution-for-data-lake-challenges/), \\ntargets _\'interoperability\'_ among different lakehouse table formats. By being a lightweight translation layer, \\nOneTable allows users to seamlessly translate metadata between the source and target table formats, without the need to \\nrewrite or duplicate the actual data files.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/images/blog/XTable/xtable-github.png\\" alt=\\"drawing\\" style={{width:\'80%\', display:\'block\', marginLeft:\'auto\', marginRight:\'auto\', marginTop:\'18pt\', marginBottom:\'18pt\'}} />\\n\\nThe goal of OneTable was to anchor its success in neutrality, guided by strong community values. From the very beginning, \\nthe project[ expressed its desire](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/XTable+Proposal) to be incubated \\nunder the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/). Today, we are excited to announce that OneTable has been \\naccepted as an incubating project by Apache and will henceforth be known as **Apache XTable\u2122**. As part of the incubation, \\nthe project has transitioned the code repository to the Apache infrastructure and adopted the \\n[community-driven development principles](https://community.apache.org/) of the Apache Foundation.\\n\\nWhile XTable is in its early phases, it has quickly been gaining significant momentum within the lakehouse community. \\nThe project has already garnered over [560 GitHub stars](https://x.com/apachextable/status/1725247462280196465?s=20), \\nmore than 1000 clones and 70 forks, indicating a rapidly \\n[growing interest](https://x.com/apachextable/status/1725685237215322294?s=20). Additionally, XTable has a diverse set \\nof contributors from organizations such as Microsoft, Onehouse, Google, Walmart, Adobe, Cloudera, and Dremio. With the \\nApache incubation, we are also looking forward to connecting with more contributors who have similar interests in this space.\\n\\nIncubating XTable at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) signifies more than just the technical evolution of a project; \\nit\'s a step towards fostering a vibrant community around it. This milestone is exciting for several reasons. Firstly, \\nthe ASF\'s incubation process is renowned for its emphasis on community development and open governance, aligning \\nperfectly with our vision for XTable. By embracing the Apache way, we\'re not just contributing code; we\'re building a \\nfoundation for a project that\'s open, inclusive, and sustainable. The incubation phase will equip XTable with the \\nmentoring and services necessary to thrive as a Top Level Project (TLP), ensuring it benefits from the ASF\'s vendor-neutral \\nenvironment.\\n\\nThis environment encourages innovation, collaboration, and the sharing of ideas, making it an ideal breeding ground for \\nXTable to grow. Moreover, the ASF\'s global reach and reputation will enhance XTable\'s visibility and adoption, creating \\nnew opportunities for collaboration with other projects and communities. We\'re excited about the journey ahead and the \\npotential for XTable to become a key part of the ASF ecosystem, contributing to its mission of providing software for \\nthe public good.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/images/blog/XTable/xtable-docs.png\\" alt=\\"drawing\\" style={{width:\'80%\', display:\'block\', marginLeft:\'auto\', \\nmarginRight:\'auto\', marginTop:\'18pt\', marginBottom:\'18pt\'}} />\\n\\nFor those interested in exploring Apache XTable\u2122, the official website is a good starting point. The documentation \\nsection hosts a great hands-on [quickstart](https://xtable.apache.org/docs/how-to) guide to getting acquainted with XTable, \\nproviding a straightforward way to experience its interoperability capabilities firsthand. If you have specific ideas, \\nquestions, or seek direct interaction, the [discussions](https://github.com/apache/incubator-xtable/discussions) section \\nis available for more in-depth exchanges. We invite you to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or \\nfilling issues to the [XTable GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/incubator-xtable). Contributions in the early \\nphase of the project are going to be critical as we build XTable together. Joining the \\n[XTable mailing list](mailto:dev-subscribe@xtable.apache.org) is another excellent way to stay informed and engage with \\nthe project. We are really excited about the future of Apache XTable\u2122 and building it together with the vibrant data community.\\n\\nFollow Apache XTable\u2122 on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apache-xtable/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apachextable) \\nto keep up with the latest updates!"},{"id":"/interop-lakehouse","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/interop-lakehouse","source":"@site/blog/interop-lakehouse.mdx","title":"OneTable: A Catalyst for an Open and Interoperable Lakehouse","description":"Redirecting... please wait!!","date":"2023-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"onetable","permalink":"/blog/tags/onetable"},{"label":"interoperability","permalink":"/blog/tags/interoperability"}],"readingTime":0.045,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sushil K."}],"frontMatter":{"title":"OneTable: A Catalyst for an Open and Interoperable Lakehouse","author":"Sushil K.","category":"blog","image":"images/blog/onetable-launch/onetable-cover.png","tags":["onetable","interoperability"],"date":"2023-12-26T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"OneTable is now \u201cApache XTable\u2122 (Incubating)\u201d","permalink":"/blog/OneTable-is-now-Apache-XTable"},"nextItem":{"title":"OneTable: Interoperability for Apache Hudi, Iceberg and Delta Lake","permalink":"/blog/onetable-intro-dip"}},"content":"import Redirect from \'@site/src/components/Redirect\';\\n\\n<Redirect url=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/onetable-catalyst-open-interoperable-lakehouse-sushil-kumar-xprre/\\">Redirecting... please wait!!
